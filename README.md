## Counters with Instruments ... and Tremolo audio effect branch
This branch is based on Counters with Instruments + Tremolo audio effect! (Upgraded to iOS 9.0)

This is a "custom-made" effect subclassing AUAudioUnit. The Tremolo effect algorithm runs is in the function "process" inside TremoloDSPKernel class.

Counter with Instruments has a built-in SimpleSynth playing one note. The notes are randomly generated out of C, E, G notes (C Major chord) in various octaves. Slowing down counters' counting increases reverb wet/dry parameter. 
All programmed using AVAudioEngine, AVAudioPlayerNode classes, with code generated soundwaves into AVAudioPCMBuffer buffers, plus AVAudioMixerNode and AVAudioUnitReverb.
