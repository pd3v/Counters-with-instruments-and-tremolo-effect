# Counters with Instruments branch
This branch is totally based on Counters but with sound! This time each Counter has a built-in SimpleSynth playing one note. The notes are randomly generated out of C, E, G notes (C Major chord) in various octaves. Slowing down counters' counting increases reverb wet/dry parameter. 
All programmed using AVAudioEngine, AVAudioPlayerNode classes, with code generated soundwaves into AVAudioPCMBuffer buffers, plus AVAudioMixerNode and AVAudioUnitReverb.
